# Ionic 2 by Example

Here you can find the code for all the examples used in the _Ionic 2 by Example_ course.

Each sample app is available as a separate branch, and you can look at the commits to see the changes made at each step, as explained in the course:

* [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/mirkonasato/ionic2-by-example/commits/expense-tracker)

There's also a sample backend project used to demonstrate how to integrate with a RESTful API:
